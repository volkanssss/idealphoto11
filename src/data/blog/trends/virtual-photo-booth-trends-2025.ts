This comprehensive guide explores the trends defining virtual photo booths this year.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. AI-Powered Photo Enhancement</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing photo quality and editing capabilities. Modern virtual photo booths now incorporate smart enhancement features that automatically optimize lighting, remove blemishes, and suggest optimal compositions.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Intelligent Background Replacement</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Advanced AI algorithms can now seamlessly replace backgrounds in real-time, allowing users to transport themselves to exotic locations, famous landmarks, or custom scenes without green screens.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Smart Filter Recommendations</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">AI analyzes photo composition, lighting conditions, and subject matter to recommend the most flattering filters and adjustments, taking the guesswork out of photo editing.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Augmented Reality Integration</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AR technology is blurring the line between physical and virtual photo experiences. Real-time AR filters and effects add interactive elements that respond to movement and environment.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Virtual accessories now appear in realistic 3D, maintaining proper perspective and lighting as users move. From glasses and hats to full costume elements, AR props enhance creativity without physical inventory.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Interactive Animations</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Animated elements that react to facial expressions, gestures, or voice commands create dynamic, engaging photo experiences. These interactive features are particularly popular at events and parties.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Personalization and Customization</h2>
