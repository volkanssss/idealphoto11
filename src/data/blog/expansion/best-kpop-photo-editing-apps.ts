    <p class="mb-4">Creating 'polco' (polaroid decoration) or digital edits is a huge part of fandom culture. Here are the tools you need.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. SNOW</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The classic. Famous for its cute animal stickers and superior beauty filters. It's the standard for selfies in Korea.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. MEITU</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Powerhouse editing. You can remove backgrounds, add 'Art' effects, and resize bodies (use responsibly!). Great for creating fantastical edits.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Polarr</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">For the creators. Use 'codes' to apply custom user-generated filters. Fandoms often share specific Polarr codes that match a group's comeback aesthetic.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Nichi</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Best for collage and layout. It has a beautiful, scrapbook-style interface perfect for making digital journals of your idol.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Ideal Photo (Web)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Yes, us! For specific <a href="/kpop-photobooth">Idol Frames</a> where you can pose WITH the idol, nothing beats a dedicated browser-based tool designed specifically for this purpose.</p>
