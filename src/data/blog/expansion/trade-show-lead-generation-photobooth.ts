    <p class="mb-4">Trade show floors are competitive. You have 3 seconds to grab attention. A photobooth does that, but it's what happens <em>after</em> the snap that matters for your sales funnel.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Exchange of Value</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Nobody wants to give their email for a "newsletter." But everyone wants their cool photo sent to them. The photobooth creates a fair exchange of value. They get a memory; you get a contact.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Custom Survey Questions</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Don't just ask for email. Add a qualifying question on the download screen. "What is your timeline for software purchase?" (a) Immedate (b) 6 Months. Now your sales team knows exactly who to call first.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Instant Follow-up</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The email delivering the photo is your first touchpoint. Customize it! "Here is your photo, and by the way, here is a 10% discount code for visiting our booth." The open rate on these emails is near 100%—unheard of in standard marketing.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">GDPR Compliance</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Make sure your digital booth has a clear "I agree to receive marketing" checkbox. It keeps you compliant and ensures your list is high-quality.</p>
