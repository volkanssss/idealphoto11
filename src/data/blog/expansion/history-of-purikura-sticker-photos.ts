    <p class="mb-4">Before Instagram filters, there was Purikura (Print Club). Originating in Japan in 1995, these machines allowed users to take photos and decorate them with digital stickers, frames, and graffiti.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Golden Era (1990s-2000s)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Purikura became a cultural staple for teenagers across Asia. The defining features were:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Skin Lightening & Eye Enlarging:</strong> The earliest 'beauty filters'.</li>
        <li><strong>Graffiti Time:</strong> A limited time to draw on the screen with a stylus.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Cutting:</strong> Sharing the tiny stickers with friends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Korean Wave (Life4Cut)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">In recent years, South Korea revitalized the concept. Brands like Life4Cut (Insaengnecut) stripped back the chaotic graffiti for a cleaner, more aesthetic 4-frame strip. It became less about the decoration and more about the posing and lighting.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Digital Future</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Now, apps like <a href="/">Ideal Photo</a> are bringing this full circle. We offer the clean lines of Korean booths with the digital decoration fun of classic Purikura, all in your browser.</p>
