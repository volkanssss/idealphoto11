    <p class="mb-4">A photobooth is fun, but a photobooth <em>game</em> is a memory maker. Break the ice and get even the shyest guests in front of the camera with these interactive challenges.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. The Photo Scavenger Hunt</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Leave a checklist on each table. "Find a guest wearing red," "Take a photo with the bride's mother," "Make a funny face with the groom." The first table to complete the list wins a prize!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Pose Charades</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Place a bowl of prompts near the booth. Guests pick one out and have to act it out in the photo. "Zombie Apocalypse," "Winning the Lottery," "Secret Agent." The resulting photos are hilarious.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Kissing Contest</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Challenge couples to recreate iconic movie kisses. The Notebook, Spiderman, Titanic. Display the best ones on a projector during dinner.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. "Guess the Guest"</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Guests take photos holding a sign with a fun fact about themselves (but hiding their face). Later, the couple tries to guess who is who based on the fact!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Time Capsule Messages</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Ask guests to write a prediction for the couple 10 years from now on a whiteboard and take a photo with it. "They will have 3 kids," "Still arguing about pizza toppings." It's a digital guestbook you'll treasure forever.</p>
