    <p class="mb-4">The annual office party is a tradition, but how do you translate that to a distributed team? forced karaoke on Zoom is awkward. Here are better ideas.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. The Ugly Sweater Photobooth</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You can't see the full sweater on a webcam call. Use a <a href="/digibooth">virtual photobooth</a> link where everyone uploads a full-body shot of their ugly outfit. The gallery updates live during the party!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Digital Secret Santa</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Use apps like Elfster to organize gift exchanges. Open the gifts on camera, but snap a screenshot reaction using a dedicated booth app to capture the genuine surprise.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Cocktail Making Class</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Send everyone a kit beforehand. Hire a mixologist to teach the group via video. Everyone raises a toast at the end.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Yearbook Superlatives</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Vote on "Most likely to..." awards during the call. Present the winners with a custom-generated certificate photo that they can share on Slack.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Remote teams need connection more than ever. A well-planned virtual event with high-quality photo engagement can bridge the distance.</p>
