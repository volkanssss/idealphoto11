    <p class="mb-4">The backdrop is the anchor of your photobooth. It frames every shot. But professional rentals can cost upwards of $300. Here are three stunning backdrops you can make yourself for a fraction of the price.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. The Streamer Wall</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cost:</strong> ~$30</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Materials:</strong> Crepe paper rolls in 3-4 coordinating colors, masking tape, fishing line.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>How-to:</strong> Cut varying lengths of crepe paper. Tape them to a long string or directly to the wall. Twist them for texture. Layer colors for a rich, festive look. It catches the light beautifully and moves slightly, adding life to photos.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. The Faux Flower Wall</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cost:</strong> ~$80 (vs $500 rental)</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Materials:</strong> Foam boards, wholesale silk flowers (buy in bulk online), hot glue.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>How-to:</strong> You don't need to cover the <em>entire</em> board. Focus on the top corners and center. Create a vignette effect. It photographs just as well as a full wall but costs half as much.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. The Rustic Pallet & Lights</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cost:</strong> Free to ~$20</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Materials:</strong> Wooden pallets (often free from hardware stores), fairy lights.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>How-to:</strong> Sand down the pallets to avoid splinters. Stand them vertically and secure them safely. Drape battery-operated fairy lights over them. Add a "Mr. & Mrs." wooden sign in the center. Instant rustic charm.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Pro Tip for Virtual Booths</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you're using a <a href="/wedding-photobooth">virtual booth app</a>, you don't even need a physical backdrop! Use our Greenscreen AI feature to digitally replace the background with anything you want—the Eiffel Tower, a floral wall, or a custom monogram.</p>
