    <p class="mb-4">Your collection is art. Treat it like art. A 'shrine' doesn't have to be cluttered; it can be a stylish focal point of your room.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. The Grid Wall</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Use a simple wire grid panel ($15). Clip your favorite photocards and lightsticks to it using wooden clothespins. Add fairy lights for a cozy vibe.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Floating Shelves</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"> dedicate a shallow picture ledge shelf to your albums. Face them forward so the cover art shows. Rotate them weekly to change the 'theme' of your room.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. The Macrame Hanging</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">For a boho look, hang a macrame string and clip your polaroids to it. This looks softer and more organic than a rigid grid.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Digital Photo Frame</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Running out of space? Load all your digital edits from our <a href="/kpop-photobooth">photobooth</a> onto a digital frame. It cycles through thousands of images so you never get bored.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Remember: keep your precious prints out of direct sunlight to prevent fading!</p>
