    <p class="mb-4">You've selected your favorite idol in our <a href="/kpop-photobooth">K-pop Photobooth</a>. Now, what do you do with your hands? Don't just stand there! Try these iconic poses.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. The Finger Heart (Small)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The classic. Cross your thumb and index finger to make a tiny heart. Subtle and cute.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. The Cheek Heart (Bol-Heart)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Curve your hand like a 'C' and place it against your cheek. If you are taking a photo with an idol, ask them to complete the other half!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Gyaru Peace (Upside Down V)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Turn your peace sign upside down. It's the trendy pose of the 4th Gen idols. (Check out IVE's Rei for inspiration).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Cat Ears</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Make fists and put them on top of your head. Essential for any 'cute' concept photo.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. The 'End' Pose</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Mimic the ending fairy pose of your favorite song. Breath heavily, look at the camera intensely, and hold still!</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Practice these in the mirror, then head to the booth to snap the perfect pic.</p>
