    <p class="mb-4">Wedding photobooths are a staple of modern receptions, but the props are evolving. In 2025, we're saying goodbye to flimsy paper mustaches and hello to high-quality, personalized, and sustainable props. Here are the top 10 trends you need to know.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Custom Neon Signs</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Nothing says 'party' like a customized neon sign held by the bride and groom. Phrases like 'Drunk in Love' or the couple's new last name are top choices. They add a vibrant pop of color to every photo.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Sustainable & Wooden Props</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">With eco-conscious weddings on the rise, laser-cut wooden props are replacing plastic. They look rustic, elegant, and are completely biodegradable.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Oversized Heads</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Funny and memorable! Printed oversized cutouts of the groom's face, the bride's face, or even the family pet are huge this year.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Digital Stickers & AR Filters</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you're using a <a href="/wedding-photobooth">virtual wedding photobooth</a>, digital props are the way to go. No mess, no cleanup, and infinite options.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Vintage Frames</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Thrifted, ornate gold frames for guests to hold up create a beautiful 'picture within a picture' effect that screams vintage elegance.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Chalkboard Speech Bubbles</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Let your guests write their own messages. It's interactive and results in hilarious inside jokes captured on camera.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Floral Garlands</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Fresh or high-quality silk flower crowns and garlands add a bohemian touch perfect for outdoor or barn weddings.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. 'Team Bride' & 'Team Groom' Sunglasses</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A classic that never dies, but 2025 sees these in retro heart shapes and pastel colors.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Pet Cutouts</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Can't bring your dog to the venue? Bring a cardboard cutout so Fido can still be in the family photos!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. Thematic Hats</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">From captain's hats to vintage fascinators, high-quality headwear is replacing the cheap foam hats of the past.</p>
