    <p class="mb-4">Traditionally, a "good" photobooth meant a Canon DSLR and a strobe flash. Today, a "good" photobooth means AI filters, instant sharing, and digital props. The battle has shifted from hardware to software.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Hardware Plateau</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Camera sensors haven't changed drastically in 5 years. A 2020 sensor captures more detail than you can see on an Instagram screen. Investing thousands in new cameras yields diminishing returns.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Software Boom</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Software is evolving weekly. Features like:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>AI Background Removal:</strong> No green screen needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Beauty Filters:</strong> Skin smoothing that looks natural.</li>
        <li><strong>AR Masks:</strong> Snapchat-style face tracking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">These are what users care about. They want the photo to be <em>fun</em> and <em>flattering</em>, not necessarily 24 megapixels of raw sharpness.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Verdict</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Invest in a decent iPad and a great ring light (Hardware). But spend your real energy choosing the right <a href="/">Photobooth App</a> (Software). That is where the user experience lives.</p>
