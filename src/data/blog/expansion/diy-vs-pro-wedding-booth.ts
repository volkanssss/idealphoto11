    <p class="mb-4">One of the biggest debates in wedding planning: Do we hire a professional photobooth company or set up a DIY station? Both have merits, but the right choice depends on your budget, venue, and patience. Let's break it down.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Professional Route</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Zero Stress:</strong> An attendant handles setup, operation, and takedown.</li>
        <li><strong>Print Quality:</strong> Dye-sublimation printers invoke professional lab quality in seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> DSLR cameras and studio lighting ensure everyone looks their best.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Expect to pay $600-$1200 for a 4-hour rental.</li>
        <li><strong>Footprint:</strong> They can take up significant space in your venue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The DIY Route</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Cost Effective:</strong> You likely already own an iPad or camera.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Total control over the backdrop and software.</li>
        <li><strong>All Night Long:</strong> No hourly limit. The booth stays open as long as the reception lasts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Hybrid Solution: Virtual Booths</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">In 2025, a third option is dominating: The <a href="/wedding-photobooth">Virtual Wedding Booth</a>. Using a service like Ideal Photo, your guests use their <em>own</em> smartphones.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This eliminates lines, costs almost nothing compared to rentals, and allows guests to take photos anywhere in the venue—not just in a corner. You get a digital gallery of every moment, and guests get instant shareable memories.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Verdict</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you have a large budget and want physical prints, go Professional. If you want fun, flexibility, and to save $1000+, go with a Virtual or DIY setup using an iPad ring light.</p>
